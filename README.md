## 🏥 The Problem

India has **1.5M+ registered companies**. Every single one needs MCA, SEBI, GST, and Income Tax compliance. Companies pay ₹10,000–25,000/month to CA firms just for compliance monitoring — done manually, via spreadsheets and WhatsApp reminders.

**ComplianceX** replaces that with **5 specialist AI agents**.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 📡 **Doctor 1** | **The News & Auditor** | Monitors 40+ regulations across MCA/SEBI/GST and cross-references them against your CA's filings to detect outdated work |
| ⚖️ **Doctor 2** | **The Rule Checker** | Checks your company against every active compliance rule |

### Background Automation (APScheduler — 60s loops):
* `job_deadline_scanner` → auto-alerts + filing requests for overdue companies
* `job_regulation_detector` → maps live news → affected sectors → company alerts
* `job_filing_escalator` → PENDING → HIGH alert (24h) → EMERGENCY (48h)
* `activity_log` → `GET /activity-log` → ActivityFeed UI (5s polling)

### News Feed:
Live scrapers (PIB / SEBI / Income Tax / MCA) + 40-item curated synthetic dataset → merged, deduped, sorted by date → `POST /news/analyze` → Gemini 2.5 Flash → Structured breakdown modal (Rule, Impact, Actions, Deadline, Penalty).

### Tech Stack:
* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, ChromaDB, Sentence Transformers, APScheduler
* **AI:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (chat, remediation, news analysis)
* **Vector DB:** ChromaDB with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings
* **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
* **Data:** 12-company MCA dataset + 40-item curated regulatory news dataset

## 💻 Portals

The platform is split into two distinct, synchronised React applications:

1. **CA Portal (Port 5173):** A professional workstation for Chartered Accountants. Features a dark-themed, glassmorphic grid layout, risk dashboard, tax analysis tools, action-oriented calendar, and filing request management.
2. **Executive Portal (Port 5174):** A refined, secure dashboard for company executives. Includes real-time KPI tracking, signature/action requirements, company-scoped regulatory impact feeds, and a dedicated AI Chat assistant powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash for contextual compliance advice.

## ⚡ Automation Engine

Running as background jobs (60-second intervals) from server startup:

| Job | Trigger | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `job_deadline_scanner` | Every 60s | Scans all 12 companies; creates alerts + filing requests for overdue GST/MCA/Tax |
| `job_regulation_detector` | Every 60s | Fetches live news → maps sector → affected companies → creates alerts |
| `job_filing_escalator` | Every 60s | Escalates PENDING requests: HIGH alert at 24h, EMERGENCY at 48h |

*All events are written to `activity_log` (in-memory, max 50 entries) and exposed via `GET /activity-log`.*

The `ActivityFeed.jsx` component polls this endpoint every 5 seconds and renders live entries with slide-in animations, severity-coloured left borders, and a per-second countdown to the next scan.

## 📊 Risk Scoring Model

$$\text{Score} = \sum(\text{violation severity points}) + \text{overdue filings} \times 5 \text{ (max 20)} + \text{sector risk index} \times 10 + \text{disqualified dirs} \times 15 + \text{violations last 12m} \times 3 + \text{chronic delay bonus } +8 \text{ (if avg } > 60\text{ days)}$$

*(Capped at 100)*

**Risk Buckets:**
* `0–25`: **LOW**
* `26–50`: **MEDIUM**
* `51–75`: **HIGH**
* `76–100`: **CRITICAL**

* **Always-visible synthetic data** — Curated items are always merged with any live-scraped news.
* **Stale category fallback** — If a category tab has no recent live news, shows the last-ever item in that category with a muted dashed card and ⚠️ warning banner.
* **Detail modal** — Clicking any card opens a full-screen structured breakdown instead of navigating away.
* **Per-card analysis cache** — Re-opening the same card is instant (no re-fetch).
